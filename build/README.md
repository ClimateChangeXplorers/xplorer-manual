**PARTS LIST**

Before getting started, you should consult the complete list of parts
and hardware that can be found at:

* See the
  [Google spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hnn0Ms2DzVQgRFmGBpLQ9W2NGEz2gopc/view?usp=sharing)
  for the full, up-to-date list of _non-printed_ parts for building a
  complete station. The vast majority of parts can be found on Amazon,
  through online electronics distributors and through your local
  hardware store.

**Note:** the base case build has quantities preset to 1 item. Also,
**alternative power options** are also listed in this document for users
interested in further customizing their station to specific power needs.

If you only wish to do tabletop testing, you will only need to follow
the [flash instructions](https://github.com/ClimateChangeXplorers/xplorer-manual/tree/master/flash) for the microcontroller and then proceed to
the [tabletop testing](#skeletontabletop-testing). This will eliminate
the need for making wiring bundles, constructing a PVC frame or printing
the 3d-printed housing.
